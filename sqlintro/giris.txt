First, create a PHP workspace so you have PHP, MySQL, and Apache installed right away. You can then make sure you have MySQL installed by running:
		mysql-ctl install
Then install phpMyAdmin:
		phpmyadmin-ctl install
After the installation is complete you'll just want to make sure mysql is running once more:
		mysql-ctl start
After installing phpMyAdmin, you were given a link to access 
PHPMyAdmin which will follow the pattern of: https://[workspacename]-[username].c9users.io/phpmyadmin. 
From that link, you can login with your Cloud9 username and a blank password.
